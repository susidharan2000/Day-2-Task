difference between document and window object?

Document Object:
=>The document object represents the entire HTML document within a browser window. It serves as an interface to access and manipulate the content, structure, and styles of a web page.
=>The document object provides a hierarchical representation(DOM structure) of the HTML elements on a webpage, allowing developers to navigate, modify, and manipulate the content dynamically.
=>The document object offers methods like:
      ->getElementById()
      ->getElementByClassName()
      ->querySelector()
   enabling developers to select specific elements based on their IDs, classes, or other attributes.
=>Properties such as document.title, document.URL, and document.body provide information about the document's title, URL, and body.
=>Content Manipulation: Through the document object, you can dynamically create, modify, or delete elements, attributes, and text content on a webpage.

Window Object:
=>The window object represents the browser window or tab containing the DOM document. It acts as a global object, providing methods and properties related to the browser environment, including navigation, location, history, and timing.
=>The window object serves as the global scope in JavaScript, meaning variables and functions declared without the var, let, or const keyword become properties of the window object.
=>The window object offers properties like:
       ->window.innerWidth
       ->window.innerHeight
       ->window.navigator
   this provides information about the browser's dimensions, navigator object, and other related details.
=>Methods such as:
       ->window.open()
       ->window.close()
       ->window.location
    allow developers to control browser navigation, open new windows or tabs.
=>The window object provides functions like:
       ->setTimeout()
       ->setInterval()
       ->clearTimeout()
    to manage time-based operations and execute code asynchronously.
